# rmi_student-evaluator

This project demonstrates the use of Remote Method Invocation (RMI), in Java. </br>
Source code can be viewed in 'src/'. </br>
</br>
To run the program: </br>
1. open a command prompt and navigate to '~/executables'. </br>
2. for each executable, run the command 'java -jar the_filename.java'. </br>
3. In the server-side application, click each of the start buttons before proceeding in the client-side window.</br>
</br>
!warning! - If the servers are not stopped prior to exiting the application, they will be retained in the JVM,</br>
causing unusual behaviour if the program is executed additional times. </br>
Forcing the JVM to terminate will allow the program to be run again, with the expected behaviour.</br>
